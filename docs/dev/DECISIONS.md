# Compiler design decisions

Decisions about the compiler's structure that SPEC/IMPL (language and implementation contracts) and
[SETTLED](../SETTLED.md) (rejected language changes) do not record: new representations, components and vocabulary
entries, responsibilities moved between phases, temporary structures and working-process decisions. The reduction
[plan](../../draft/Proposals/2026-10-10%20Compiler%20Size%20Reduction%20and%20Single%20MIR%20Plan.md) §18 holds the
decisions of its adoption; this log holds the later ones. [COMPILER_ARCHITECTURE](COMPILER_ARCHITECTURE.md) states the
rules that result from them.

- An entry gives its id, date and decider, the decision, the options rejected and why, and the stage that removes a
  temporary structure. It is added in the commit that first implements it. A superseded entry stays and names its
  replacement.
- This log is the authority. Planning and handoff files under `artifacts/` (ignored by Git) cite entries by id instead of
  restating them; a decision recorded only there is not in force.
- Open questions belong in PLAN until decided.

## Working process

- **Q1 Quality mechanisms** (2026-10-12, owner).
  - Adopted: the size budget counts logical size, non-trivia C# tokens (Code Rules Analyzer A1, before R4); restructuring
    and behavior changes are separate commits (AGENTS, [VERIFICATION](VERIFICATION.md#behavior-preserving-commits)); design
    decisions are taken in the design step and recorded here (AGENTS); context stays small: from Code Rules Analyzer A1 each canonical
    component's entry file begins with its contract, and documents keep current rules and positions in short rows.
  - Deferred: metamorphic tests and fuzzing for shape-dependent code; consolidating tests into data-driven corpora;
    per-phase performance budgets; per-session goal metrics, the sequencing of R7 and R8 with milestone work, and lighter
    commit records.
- **Q2 Code Rules Analyzer** (2026-10-11, owner). The
  [proposal](../../draft/Proposals/2026-10-11%20Code%20Rules%20Analyzer.md) §9: rules KR1xxx–KR3xxx and the built-in unused-code
  rules as build errors over a shrinking baseline, units A0–A8 after R3 and before R4. The limits are in
  COMPILER_ARCHITECTURE (structure limits).
- **Q3 Compiler allocations** (2026-10-11, owner, AGENTS `8071549f`). An allocation in the compiler is allowed when it
  makes equivalent work faster or reduces compiler code with a reasonable increase in memory, measured and recorded.
  Supersedes plan §18 P11 and §14-8. Native allocation counts and O2 run time may not regress.

## Code rules (2026-10-12)

- **CR-A0** (owner). Begin the adopted Code Rules Analyzer A0–A8 before R4. KR3003 covers only
  all-new-local `var (...)` deconstruction declarations with computed tuple elements. Existing-variable assignments
  are excluded: even uncaptured, syntactically independent locals change observably when a later RHS throws or reads
  a ref alias. Rejected: extending capture/dependency checks into an effect/alias proof; it adds machinery for a density
  rule. Compare diagnostics, semantic/HIR/MIR snapshots and generated IR, not DLL bytes (commit metadata differs).
  Intake changes architecture policy only; A1–A8 introduce implementation and enforcement.

- **CR-A1** (planning session, independently reviewed). CompilerSizeBudgetTest owns one file scan for all area and
  total caps. Count parsed C# tokens without trivia, EOF or missing tokens; discard each tree after counting. Header
  comments mark generated files; LLVM templates retain their newline cap. A0 measured 835,421 tokens / 128,885 C# lines,
  excluding 1,687 generated lines and 2,335 template lines. Convert approved caps at fixed area ratios (future totals at
  the whole-compiler ratio), rounding upward. Reject replacing each of the twelve scans with a parse: it repeats the
  same work. No compiler behavior changes; add entry-file contracts required by Q1. The counter initially belongs to
  the budget test; A2 moves it into the analyzer source owner and deletes the test copy. Reject a shared utility project
  for this single operation. Only aggregate totals survive each file; no syntax-tree cache or whole-compiler tree graph.

- **CR-A2** (planning session, two independent designs compared). CodeRulesAnalyzer owns one compilation's immutable
  configuration, file-local observations and one completion sort/merge with the baseline. Choose flat file batches,
  published once, over concurrent dictionaries per key: fewer allocations, locks and state owners. CodeRule owns the
  catalogue; CodeRulesConfiguration normalizes repository paths; CodeRulesSource owns counts and anchors;
  CodeRulesBaseline owns matching and stale rows.
  Move A1's counter into CodeRulesSource and delete its test copy. Pass the one globalconfig as both analyzer config
  and AdditionalFile, using SourceText's byte checksum and algorithm; scripts share one SARIF reader with Verify.
  Resolve suppression attributes semantically, including aliases; do not maintain an alias-name approximation.
  Actual SDK 10.0.401 csc tests retained suppressed KR/IDE0052 records, including member/type/assembly and unconditional
  attributes, and preserved BOM/CRLF checksums (A2 premise evidence). No fallback for incomplete Report or bad config.
  Observe over-limit measurements only. A completely observed baseline row whose measurement no longer exceeds its
  ordinary limit is redundant and is pruned, rather than retaining a smaller ineffective bound or resolving every
  member's symbol. Report absence as absence, never as a measured zero. This normalizes proposal §3.5's minimum rule;
  later approved lower limits do not restore deleted rows. Required exception/suppression checks are independent.
  KimiCodeRulesLog sets ErrorLog only in Kimi.csproj, with SARIF 2.1 in the project: a solution-wide ErrorLog is
  overwritten by later projects, and an unescaped command-line comma is an MSBuild property separator. Keep one
  shared SARIF reader for reporting and Verify. Initialize requires the newly introduced rule IDs and cannot replace
  existing keys. Static descriptor fields satisfy Roslyn release tracking; catalogue rows reference them without
  repeating IDs or messages. LocalOwner chooses the closest declaration with a documentation ID, cached with source
  identities; collection and name paths share that decision. This includes field declarators in initializers and
  excludes unrelated members from top-level collisions. A declaration without an ID is not a file identity.
  Incomplete declarations produce no member anchor; a successful compiler build remains mandatory for Report use.

- **CR-A3a** (planning session, two independent designs compared). A3's semantic dependency check exposed Koto's
  direct reads of Binding.IsRunning/Result, missed by the old call-only regex. HirTables owns HasCurrentBinding's
  existing fact: move the complete predicate there, using State(node), and keep Koto as an R6 forwarding property.
  Binding.ObjectViews and SemanticQuery read the owner directly. Preserve the exact short-circuit order: do not obtain
  Compilation.Binding before confirming Resolved, because that getter lazily allocates Binding. No state or cache is
  added. Reject relaxing the dependency rule or moving the predicate into SemanticQuery, which requires a query-instance
  access path from syntax. Prepare this behavior-preserving structure in a separate commit before A3 enforcement.
  Delete the syntax-owned predicate and Binding's reads through it. Measured delta: Binding +48 tokens / +4 lines,
  Parsing -25 tokens / -1 line. Verify rebind invalidation, SyntaxId/HIR reuse, allocation regressions and A0 snapshots.

- **CR-A3** (planning session, two independent designs compared). CodeRulesArchitecture owns one immutable resolved
  dependency/member/vocabulary policy per compilation. Configuration owns raw lists and locations. Enumerate source
  types once and publish all declaration layers per original type; partial types cannot hide a forbidden declaration.
  Resolve configured types once and cache each file's longest-prefix layer (compiler_root matches direct files only).
  Choose layer arrays over a fixed-width mask: no extra layer-count concept or cap. Reject per-reference display names,
  syntax reclassification and concurrent symbol caches. SimpleNameSyntax owns normal references; AttributeSyntax owns
  its terminal name and shares its constructor symbol with suppression checking. Qualification types, type arguments
  and attribute arguments keep their own references; XML documentation is not a dependency. This replaces the other
  independent design's complete-name/member-access classifier with fewer syntax-shape decisions.
  Member selectors match the configured type family, including derived Koto slots and overrides. Global child-walk
  prohibitions use bare member names, including declarations: removed members need not exist to remain forbidden.
  Resolve only candidate member names in unconstrained layers. Count each configured enum once, including aliases but
  excluding implicit fields; a missing enum is located KR9002 (Warning in Enforce/Report, Error in Verify), not invalid
  input that prevents Report completion. CodeRule owns stale severity and wording for both configuration and baseline.
  Delete the two MIR dependency tests, vocabulary theory, three migrated source-pattern rows and their exclusive
  helpers. Retain SemanticSlots only for the test-source ratchet, which is outside analyzer scope. Expected change:
  350–500 analyzer lines, about 250 test lines and 90–110 deleted test lines; compiler source delta zero. Measure actual
  csc/analyzer time; do not claim a speedup from replacing tests alone.
  Actual csc exposed A2's list truncation: Roslyn treats semicolons as inline comments, including in globalconfig.
  Choose the independent reviewer's comma-separated lists, verified with the actual parser, and replace all list
  separators together. Reject a separate AdditionalFile parser and escaping/compatibility paths: one file must have
  one grammar. Tests construct effective options through AnalyzerConfig.Parse/AnalyzerConfigSet from the same text
  supplied as AdditionalFile; delete their line-splitting approximation. This also preserves both legacy exclusions.
  Semantic checking then exposed 29 existing builder references to BoundArgumentOperation through CallPlan's published
  ReceiverOperation/ArgumentOperations. Name that already-public result type in mir_build's allow list only; reject
  transitive return-type allowance. The other two missed references were Koto's Binding-state decision, moved to its
  existing fact owner in the separate behavior-preserving CR-A3a commit. Neither repair creates a new language rule.

## R2b (2026-10-11, main session, as recommended)

- **R2b-D1** `BoundType` stays the Type representation until R7; `TyCtxt` owns interning and `Subst` converts.
- **R2b-D2** The HIR publisher runs lazily, at most once per Binding pass. R7 writes the columns inline and deletes it.
- **R2b-D3** The declaration-table views (`ImplTable`, `VTableDef`, `UniversalRelations`, `EffectBoundTable`,
  `AvailableBounds`) are built by their first reader (R4, R5).
- **R2b-D5** `BoundMatch` and `BoundClosure` keep their names (the plan's PatternPlan and ClosureDef) until R6.
- **R2b-D7** `HirAdjust` = `HirAcquire` + `HirAdaptation`: `@move` and `@copy` are operand Adjusts, `@ref`, `@uniq` and
  `@raw` are `Op = Borrow`, `@follow` is `Deref`, and numeric conversions are `Op = Convert`.
- **R2b-D9** The HIR snapshot is a separate `.hir.txt` per case (`KIMI_SEMANTIC_HIR=1`).
- D4, D6, D8, D10 and D11 set R2b's budget, published views and unit order; their results are in the stage ledger and
  PLAN_HISTORY.

## R3 (2026-10-11, main session as recommended; R3-9 and R3-10 by the owner)

- **R3-1** MIR records (construction `Unsupported_Kd`, validator `InternalInvariant_Kd`) are published only under the
  `mir` pipeline, in the ControlFlow partition.
- **R3-2** The R3-exit `-Pipeline mir` Session is a measurement, classified into `artifacts/verify/mir-diff/r3.tsv`; the
  gate is the plan's R3 gate.
- **R3-3** Tests read analysis and generation through the `Compilation` entry points. `TryPrepare(out var module)` reads
  wait for R5, and `Ownership.Bodies` and control-flow structure reads for the R4 dump goldens, under ratchets.
- **R3-4** R3 budget: Mir 6,600, Binding 350 lines over its R2b-exit size, Core 1,820, the old paths unchanged (D5).
- **R3-5** A built-in form without an intrinsic row gets an interim row mapping it to an existing compiler function or
  legacy helper, each with its R8 disposition.
- **R3-6** `MirDefKey` is keyed by `BindingSymbol` until R7's declaration table.
- **R3-7** `Problem(Code, SourceRef Subject)` stays minimal until R6.
- **R3-8** Default expansion stops at 65,536 MIR statements per expanded body with the Resource code
  `DefaultExpansionLimit_Kd` (IMPL §21.3.5, plan §16-10).
- **R3-9** (owner) An Array's or Dictionary's `capacity` is the temporary `IntrinsicId.Capacity`
  (`Call(Intrinsic(Capacity), [&handle])`). R5 reads the field under the current layout rules; R8 removes it with the
  representation structs. Rejected: deferring to R5 (the same choice later, plus an R3 gate exception); pulling R8's
  representation structs forward.
- **R3-10** (owner) An owning interpolation uses the temporary intrinsics `FormatBuffer` (named `FormatCapacity` until
  U16), `FormatHint` and `FormatFinish`. `FormatBuffer` creates the private buffer, where R5 chooses stack or heap;
  `FormatFinish` consumes the adapter. The estimates take the literal byte count and a TypeToken of the values' Types and
  are computed per instance in R5; the failure check reads each write's own Result. Rejected: internal library
  declarations with three more `CompilerFunctionKind` members (grows the vocabulary R8 shrinks); deferring with an R3
  gate exception. R8 removes all three; with R3-9 the `IntrinsicId` limit returns from 34 to 30.

## R4 (accepted 2026-10-11; R4 has not started)

- **R4-M1** Shadow: under `mir` the old path still decides acceptance, Problems and diagnostics. The analyses run once
  per program version after build and validation (`MirBuilder.Build`, then `MirAnalysis.Run`); MIR problems stay
  unpublished on `MirProgram` until R6 unit a; an analysis exception fails the test. Rejected: MIR deciding codes in R4
  (duplicate records and test churn twice).
- **R4-M2** Layout: `Mir/Analysis/` in namespace `Kimi.Compiler.Mir`: `MirAnalysis` (driver), `MirDataflow`,
  `MirMoveData`, `MirInit` (A1), `MirDrops` (A2), `MirLints` (A3), `MirEffects` (A4), `MirBorrows` with `.Regions`,
  `.Conflicts` and `.Origins` (A5), `MirReport` (A6). The first unit creates all of them as stubs, so parallel units never
  edit the driver.
- **R4-M3** `MirProblem(Code, Subject, Related, Requirement, Views, Fact)` with pooled fact rows; one `MirReport.Add`
  applies the derived rule (R4-M10). Core's `Problem(Code, Subject)` is unchanged until R6.
- **R4-M4** The first unit fixes the compared code set of each analysis: A1 initialization and moves; A3
  `RequireFallthrough`; A4 effect bounds and the effect-limit Unsupported; A5 Loan conflicts, default-argument access,
  Origin relations and `OwnershipStorageLimit_Kd`; every old Ownership-partition `Unsupported_Kd`. Control-flow lints,
  `TransferRequired`, `OwnershipCaseLimit`, old Internal records and capability Unsupported records pass through
  uncompared.
- **R4-M5** Compilations with an incomplete Binding are compared in their own ledger section. A new-only row there is (d)
  only if A6 shows no dependence on an Opaque site's roots; otherwise it is (b).
- **R4-M6** A2 writes a side table and does not rewrite MIR: a verdict per Drop and view class (Keep, Elide, Flag, Open)
  and the flag set and clear points; R5 code generation reads it. Rejected: rewriting MIR in place (verdicts differ per
  view, and insertions break ranges).
- **R4-M7** A3's missing fact is `MirBody.MustNotComplete(block, SourceRef)`, written by the builder and range-checked by
  the validator; it is not a vocabulary member. Rejected: inferring it from Unreachable (SPEC 14.9.2 forbids pruning).
- **R4-M8** The definition-stage capability check (A3b) moves to R5 with the single capability table; the R4 ledger
  excludes capability records.
- **R4-M9** Binding views for R4, each added to `PublishedBindingTypes` with its reason: `TyCtxt.Relate` (the single
  variance walk), `OriginAtom.Of`, `UniversalRelations.For`, `OriginClauses.Of`, `EffectBoundTable.Of`,
  `ImplTable.Witnesses`, `VTableDef.Of` and `TyCtxt.CallableBounds`. Rejected: Mir re-deriving Origins from syntax or
  scopes.
- **R4-M10** A6: a problem rooted at an Opaque site is derived and dropped; an effect caused by one is Unknown with that
  cause, and obligations on it are derived. A problem inside an Inlined scope belongs to the template's own check,
  except Loan conflicts with the caller and effect contributions. A finding rooted at a PreparedInput local maps to
  `DefaultArgument*_Kd`.
- **R4-M11** A1, A4's local facts and A5 run per `MirCases` view; A6 merges by (code, subject, Reason) with the view mask
  as the case fact. Views are never collapsed.
- **R4-M12** Library bodies are analyzed in every compilation. The library and the milestones produce no problems,
  except an (a) row whose library fix lands in the same unit.
- **R4-M13** Tests migrate per method kind (body presence, operations, cleanup verdicts, Loans, verification state, R5/R6
  residue). Ratchets: control-flow structure reads at most 1, `Ownership.Bodies` reads at most 110.
- **R4-M15** `OwnershipStorageLimit_Kd` stays the one Resource code, decided by the byte size of A5's Loan × point arena.
- **R4-M16** The ledger's classification table is tracked (`tests/xUnitTest/TestData/mir-diff/classification.tsv`); raw
  rows, reproducers and ledgers are evidence under `artifacts/verify/mir-diff/`.
- **Owner decisions, only when triggered:** O1 a MIR vocabulary member or `IntrinsicId`; O2 a total cap above 142,000;
  O3 an acceptance change outside plan Appendix B (C1–C6 and X1–X3 with a SPEC clause; T1–T4 belong to R7), any rejection
  of a milestone or library program, or a row reopening a SETTLED entry; O4 a general SPEC rule left Unsupported at the R4
  exit; O5 the unclassified count failing to fall in two sessions in a row (plan §18 P9).
